What this is
------------

This is the GOTO virtual machine project. It implements the following
components:

1. A virtual machine called GVM (GOTO Virtual Machine) that can execute
   GOTO programs with some restrictions.

2. A compiler that compiles symbolic GOTO programs to the GVM
 
To build/install the software, run the configureit script, it detects
your plattform and sets appropriate environment variables for configure
to succeed. Then proceed as described in the INSTALL file.

How to use it
-------------

After the programs have been built, you can use the tmc (turing machine
compiler) program to compile any turing machine description (see the
samples provided for the syntax). The command

	tmc -o beaver3.goto pgm/beaver3

compiles the turing machine program in the file pgm/beaver3 into
an equivalent GOTO program in the current directory. If the turing
machine program needs initial data and/or special initial position of
the read/write head, this can be added using the options described in
the tmc(1) manula page.

Once the program is compiled, the gvm(1) program can be used to run the
GOTO program. The tmc(1) compiler generates statements to display the
state of the simulated turing machine after each turing step.  If you
want to see how the GOTO machine implements the individual steps, use
the -t option.  Additional options are described in the gvm manual page.

Documentation
-------------

The doc directory contains manual pages for tmc(1) and gvm(1).
In addition, running "make gvm.pdf" in the doc directory generates,
provided your machine has a reasonably complete latex installation,
a presentation explaining the GVM project.
